# Introduction to Neural Networks for Absolute Beginners
Neural networks are a machine learning technique with which we intend to approximate a (possibly very complicated) function (or mapping) using some kind of graph constructed out of simple neurons. It has been shown that they can approximate any function. 

In such a neural network each simple neuron would simply take a certain number of inputs, multiply each by a weight, sum them up and run them through an activation function.
