# Getting Started

This repository includes pages with introductory tutiruals and materials that are crucial for the AI Track projects.
The curriculum does not include all but necessary materials on deep leanring in Python as well as useful tips from the 2022-2023 HA AI Track members. In case you see there is more to be added, feel free to contribute and extend the materials or link your own project for reference in the topics.

## Pedagogy

We have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is hands-on **project-based** and that it includes **frequent quizzes**. In addition, this curriculum has a common **theme** to give it cohesion.

By ensuring that the content aligns with projects, the process is made more engaging for students and retention of concepts will be augmented. In addition, a low-stakes quiz before a class sets the intention of the student towards learning a topic, while a second quiz after class ensures further retention. This curriculum was designed to be flexible and fun and can be taken in whole or in part. The projects start small and become increasingly complex by the end of the 12-week cycle. This curriculum also includes a postscript on real-world applications of ML, which can be used as extra credit or as a basis for discussion.
