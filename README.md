# Getting Started

This repository includes pages with introductory tutiruals and materials that are crucial for the AI Track projects.
The curriculum does not include all but necessary materials on deep leanring in Python as well as useful tips from the 2022-2023 HA AI Track members. In case you see there is more to be added, feel free to contribute and extend the materials or link your own project for reference in the topics. 

> For further study, we recommend following these [Stanford lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PLf7L7Kg8_FNxHATtLwDceyh72QQL9pvpQ&index=1) and [TU/e Master's course on computer vision](http://vca.ele.tue.nl/C418-V3-Convolutional-neural-networks-for-computer-vision.html). For Pytorch either refer to our introduction tutorial on these pages or the introduction on [Pytorch website](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)
